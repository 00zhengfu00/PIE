<h1>Supported CSS3 properties and values</h1>
<p>The following sections describe in detail the exact levels of support PIE has for certain CSS3 properties.<br>
</p>
<h2>border-radius</h2>

<p>PIE fully supports the border-radius property as defined in the CSS3
Backgrounds and Borders module specification.</p>

<pre>border-radius: [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]{1,4} [ / [ &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt; ]{1,4} ]? <br></pre>

<p>
Only the shorthand version is supported; the longhand
border-top-left-radius etc. properties are not.</p>

<p>The rounded corners are applied to the element's background area
(including solid background colors, background images, and background
gradients), the element's border, and the box-shadow if specified.<br>
</p>

<p>Both the standard border-radius property name as well as a custom
prefixed -pie-border-radius property name are recognized; if both are
present then the prefixed value will take precedence. It is recommended
to only use the standard unprefixed property when possible (in
addition, of course, to -moz- and -webkit- prefixed properties as
necessary), since the CSS3 spec for this property seems fairly
solidified, and because there are no known incompatibilities between
PIE's implementation and the standard.</p>

<p>Notes on other browsers:</p>

<p>Elliptical radii (the optional set of values after the slash) are
only supported in Firefox versions 3.5 and up. As of the current
release (3.6), percentage values for vertical radii are incorrectly
calculated relative to the width of the box whereas the CSS3 spec says
they should be relative to the height. PIE handles this correctly.</p>

<p>WebKit deviates significantly from the CSS3 spec: the shorthand
property cannot be used to specify different radii per corner, so you
must use the separate longhand properties if you want to do that. It
also does not support percentage values at all. (TODO: check this in
WebKit nightlies and recent Chrome, I think these may now match the
spec and drop the prefix.)</p>

<h2>box-shadow<br>
</h2>

<p>PIE supports the box-shadow property syntax as of its last
appearance in the CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders module. It was removed
from the spec due to, as far as I can tell, some questions around how
it should behave in conjunction with semi-transparent background
images. The plan seems to be to add it back in at some point in another
(perhaps new) CSS3 module, but I have not yet seen that happen.
Regardless, this is an extremely useful property which has widespread
support (via prefixed properties) in other browsers, so PIE includes
support as best it can.</p>

<pre>box-shadow: none | &lt;shadow&gt; [,&lt;shadow&gt;]*<br>    where &lt;shadow&gt; = inset? &amp;&amp; [ &lt;offset-x&gt; &lt;offset-y&gt; &lt;blur-radius&gt;? &lt;spread-radius&gt;? &amp;&amp; &lt;color&gt;? ]<br></pre>

<p>Both the (ex-)standard box-shadow property name as well as a custom
prefixed -pie-box-shadow property name are recognized; if both are
present the prefixed value will take precedence. It is recommended to
use the non-prefixed property when possible, since there are no known
incompatibilities between PIE's implementation and others which use the
non-prefixed property, such as Opera.</p>

<p>When used in conjunction with border-radius, the shape of the shadow
matches the shape of the rounded border box.<br>
</p>

<p>When using the blur radius parameter, the strength and size of the
blur as rendered by PIE should match that of other browsers almost
identically, however you may notice some slight differences due to
rounding, particularly when the blur is very small (this should not be
more than a one-pixel difference).</p>

<p>PIE does not currently support multiple box shadows, but support is
planned in a future version.</p>

<p>PIE does not currently support the 'inset' keyword, but support is
planned in a future version.<br>
</p>

<p>Notes on other browsers:</p>

<p>See the compatibility chart at the bottom of
https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/-moz-box-shadow</p>

<h2>border-image</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>-pie-background</h2>

<p>PIE supports CSS3 multiple background images, linear gradients as
background images, and some of the new CSS3 background aspects such as
background origin and clip. Unfortunately, to get access to these
post-CSS2 values, we have to put them in a property other than the
standard 'background' property, because IE will attempt to parse the
value internally and not allow us access to the original value string.
Therefore we use a custom -pie-background property for holding these
values.</p>

<p>Only the single -pie-background shorthand value is recognized; there
are no supported corresponding longhand values (e.g.
-pie-background-origin).</p>

<p>For backward-compatibility with browsers which do not support CSS3
backgrounds, be sure to include appropriate fallbacks. For example:</p>

<pre>#myElement {<br>    background: url(bg-image.png) no-repeat #CCC; /*non-CSS3 browsers will use this*/<br>    background: url(bg-image.png) no-repeat, -moz-linear-gradient(90deg, #CCC, #EEE); /*gecko*/<br>    background: url(bg-image.png) no-repeat, -webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top, from(#CCC) to(#EEE)); /*webkit*/ <br>    -pie-background: url(bg-image.png) no-repeat, linear-gradient(90deg, #CCC, #EEE); /*PIE*/<br>}<br></pre>

<p>While the PIE parser will allow them, the following aspects of the
background shorthand will currently be ignored when rendering:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>background-attachment (will always use 'scroll' even if 'fixed'
or 'local' are specified)</li>
  <li>background-size (will always use the image's intrinsic size)</li>
  <li>background-repeat values of 'space' or 'round' (the other repeat
values are supported)</li>
  <li>background-position values with more than 2 parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Support for these items will be added in future versions as possible.<br>
</p>

<h2>-pie-watch-ancestors</h2>

<p>PIE automatically listens for any attribute or style property
changes on the element to which the behavior is applied. This means
that if you have scripting which modifies any of the recognized CSS3
properties on the fly, those changes will automatically be picked up
and the rendering will be updated to match. For example:</p>

<pre>/* JS: */<br>myElement.onclick = function() {<br>    this.style.borderRadius = '20px';<br>};<br><br>/* CSS: */<br>#myElement {<br>    behavior: url(PIE.htc);<br>    border-radius: 10px;<br>}<br></pre>

<p>Assuming myElement has the PIE.htc behavior attached to it, the
above code will work as expected without any extra effort from the
author of the script or CSS. This seamlessness is a big part of why PIE
is so easy to use.<br>
</p>

<p>But common best-practices in scripting dictate that instead of
setting styles directly with element.style.foo, scripts should only
add/remove elements' class names, letting the actual styles
corresponding to those class names be maintained in the CSS. So
reworking the above example:</p>

<pre>/* JS: */<br>myElement.onclick = function() {<br>    this.className += ' poked';<br>}<br><br>/* CSS: */<br>#myElement {<br>    behavior: url(PIE.htc);<br>    border-radius: 10px;<br>}<br>#myElement.poked {<br>    border-radius: 20px;<br>}<br></pre>

<p>Again, since the className is being changed on the element to which
the behavior is applied, PIE will automatically be notified of the
change and update the border-radius rendering to match the new value.</p>

<p>However, what if the className is changed not on the element itself
but on one of its ancestors?</p>

<pre>/* JS: */<br>myElement.onclick = function() {<br>    this.parentNode.className += ' poked';<br>}<br><br>/* CSS: */<br>#myElement {<br>    behavior: url(PIE.htc);<br>    border-radius: 10px;<br>}<br>.poked #myElement {<br>    border-radius: 20px;<br>}<br></pre>

<p>This is a very common pattern which allows a lot of flexibility.
However, in this case, PIE will not be automatically notified of the
className change. To be notified, it will also have to add a listener
to the ancestor element. We could brute-force this by automatically
adding propertychange listeners to all the ancestors of every
PIE-targeted element, but that would be bad for performance and memory
usage. So instead, we have introduced a custom CSS property which
allows authors to tell PIE that certain ancestors should be watched:</p>

<pre>/* JS: */<br>myElement.onclick = function() {<br>    this.parentNode.className += ' poked';<br>}<br><br>/* CSS: */<br>#myElement {<br>    behavior: url(PIE.htc);<br>    border-radius: 10px;<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;">-pie-watch-ancestors: 1;</span><br>}<br>.poked #myElement {<br>    border-radius: 20px;<br>}<br></pre>

<p>This tells PIE that it should watch for changes on ancestors one
level up from the element. It will attach the propertychange listener
to the element's parent and therefore be notified when the parent's
className gets changed, and update the rendering correctly.<br>
</p>

<h2>rgba color values</h2>

<p>PIE parses RGBA color values wherever they are allowed. However it
is only able to successfully render their opacity value in a few
contexts. In all other contexts they will be rendered with the correct
RGB color, but fully opaque. Here are the supported contexts in which
the opacity will be rendered correctly:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The background-color as specified in the -pie-background property</li>
  <li>The color value of box-shadow<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>gradients</h2>

<p>PIE currently supports linear-gradient image values when used in the
-pie-background property. Use in any contexts other than the background
are not supported. The supported syntax matches that of the current
CSS3 Image Values module.</p>

<pre>linear-gradient([&lt;bg-position&gt; || &lt;angle&gt;,]? &lt;color-stop&gt;, &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]*);<br></pre>

<p>Currently all color stops are rendered fully opaque, even if
specifying an rgba color value. This is due to a limitation in VML's
linear gradient syntax which does not allow setting opacity for
individual color stops.<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
</span></p>

<p>Gradients containing color-stops which lie outside the bounding area
of the element are not currently supported, due to limitations in VML's
gradient rendering.</p>

<p>Radial gradients are not supported at this time; support would be
nice but there does not seem to be a way to make VML render true radial
gradients (they end up rectangular).</p>

<p>Notes on other browsers:</p>

<p>WebKit's gradient syntax is drastically different than that of the
CSS3 spec. See the Safari documentation for their syntax:
http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/InternetWeb/Conceptual/SafariVisualEffectsProgGuide/Gradients/Gradients.html</p>

<p>Mozilla only supports gradients (via the -moz-linear-gradient
property) as of Firefox 3.6.</p>

<p>Opera currently has no support for CSS gradients.</p>
